# sumanth_projects
Used python basic concepts to build these projects i have used concepts like loops, functions, conditional statements, list,string's and various kind of data structures and performing different kind of mathematical operations using the operators.
I have used the inbuilt keywords and dynamic data type to get the user input and manipulation of data throughout the program.
